# Understanding The Nepali Panchang

Astrology and date keeping in Nepal relies on the **Bikram Sambat (BS)** system. Yet many online tools still default to Indian AD-centric calculations.

## Problems With Generic Tools

1. Manual BS â‡„ AD conversion.
2. Missing or misaligned local festivals.
3. Fragmented Panchang elements (Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga, Karna) across sources.

> SriPatro brings these elements into one reliable place.

## What SriPatro Solves

- Unified calendar with BS + AD display.
- Accurate localized festival layering.
- Panchang, Kundali, Horoscope & tools under one roof.
- PWA offline-first experience for low connectivity areas.

| Element   | Meaning             |

| Nakshatra | Lunar mansion       |
| Yoga      | Sun + Moon relation |
