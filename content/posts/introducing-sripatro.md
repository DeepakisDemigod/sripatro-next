SriPatro started with a simple frustration: most online astrology and calendar tools were optimized for an Indian-centric workflow.

We wanted something Nepali-first:

- Native Bikram Sambat (BS) month navigation
- Panchang layers (Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga, Karna) merged from reliable sources
- Festivals & regional events displayed contextually
- A modern **PWA** experience that works offline

## What makes it different?

1. **Unified Data Merge** – Base + overlay sources merged at runtime.
2. **Locale Smartness** – Automatically detects today’s BS month.
3. **Customizable Calendar** – Toggle digits, weekly holiday, festival display and more.
4. **Performant** – Lean JSON + dynamic loading only for the month in view.

## Roadmap

- Kundali improvements
- More granular festival tagging
- Offline-first API caching
- Editorial articles and learning hub

> We believe Nepali cultural context deserves first-class tooling.
