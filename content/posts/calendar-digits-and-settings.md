Personalization helps different users (students, priests, developers) adapt the calendar to their workflow.

## Available Settings

- **Nepali Digit Style** – Switch between Devanagari and Latin numerals.
- **English Date Overlay** – Show or hide the Gregorian day number.
- **Weekly Holiday** – Pick Saturday or Sunday to highlight as recess.
- **Festivals Toggle** – Quickly declutter when you only want raw Panchang.
- **Tithi Source Preference** – Overlay `data-db` tithi value automatically.

## Why It Matters

Different professions rely on different layers of Panchang context. By letting users shape visibility, cognitive load goes down and accuracy goes up.

## Pro Tips

1. Compact mode is ideal for embedding inside dashboards.
2. Use PWA install for offline village consultations.
3. Reset cookie `calendar_settings` to return to defaults.
